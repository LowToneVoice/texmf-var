  abstract = { The ground state of a lattice with one electron per atom and antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbours only is examined by a variational method similar in principle to the treatments by Hulthén (1938) and Kasteleijn (1952) of the linear-chain problem. The calculation involves a statistical problem which is shown to be exactly equivalent to the Ising ferromagnetic problem. This cannot be solved exactly, except in the one-dimensional case, and so the Bethe–Peierls method is used to solve it approximately. In complete contradiction to the Kubo (1953) variational calculation it is concluded that all lattices have disordered ground states. The energy differences between ordered and disordered states are small and so the nature of the ground state is likely to be sensitive to small additional ordering forces. }

A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter λ which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.}

The second theorem confirms an old, unproved conjecture in the ‖B‖=‖A‖ case and yields, with ‖B‖≠‖A‖, the first provable example of itinerant-electron ferromagnetism. The theorems hold in all dimensions without even the necessity of a periodic lattice structure.},

  abstract = {We study a construction that yields a class of translation invariant states on quantum spin chains, characterized by the property that the correlations across any bond can be modeled on a finite-dimensional vector space. These states can be considered as generalized valence bond states, and they are dense in the set of all translation invariant states. We develop a complete theory of the ergodic decomposition of such states, including the decomposition into periodic “Néel ordered” states. The ergodic components have exponential decay of correlations. All states considered can be obtained as “local functions” of states of a special kind, so-called “purely generated states,” which are shown to be ground states for suitably chosen finite range VBS interactions. We show that all these generalized VBS models have a spectral gap. Our theory does not require symmetry of the state with respect to a local gauge group. In particular we illustrate our results with a one-parameter family of examples which are not isotropic except for one special case. This isotropic model coincides with the one-dimensional antiferromagnet, recently studied by Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb, and Tasaki.}

  abstract  = {We consider a quantum many-body system on a lattice with a continuous symmetry which exhibits a spontaneous symmetry breaking in its infinite volume ground states, but in which the order operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian. A typical example is the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a Neel order. In the corresponding finite system, the symmetry breaking is usually "obscured" by "quantum fluctuation" and one gets a symmetric ground state with a long range order. In such a situation, we prove that there exist ever increasing numbers of low-lying eigenstates whose excitation energies are bounded by a constant times 1/N, where N denotes the number of sites. By forming linear combinations of these low-lying states and the (finite-volume) ground state, and by taking infinite volume limits, we construct infinite volume ground states with explicit symmetry breaking. Our general theorems do not only shed light on the nature ofsymmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems, but provide indispensable information for numerical approaches to these systems. We also discuss applicatons of our general results to a variety of examples. The present paper is intended to be accessible to the readers without background in mathematical approaches to quantum many-body systems.},

In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however, for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.}},

The physical motivation for the result is that such spin systems typically either have long-range order, in which case there are gapless modes, or have only short-range correlations, in which case there are topological excitations. The result uses a set of loop operators, analogous to those used in gauge theories, defined in terms of the spin operators of the theory. We also obtain various cluster bounds on expectation values for gapped systems. These bounds are used, under the assumption of a gap, to rule out the first case of long-range order, after which we show the existence of a topological excitation. Compared to the ground state, the topologically excited state has, up to a small error, the same expectation values for all operators acting within any local region, but it has a different momentum.},

  abstract  = {We define for quantum many-body systems a quasiadiabatic continuation of quantum states. The continuation is valid when the Hamiltonian has a gap, or else has a sufficiently small low-energy density of states, and thus is away from a quantum phase transition. This continuation takes local operators into local operators, while approximately preserving the ground-state expectation values. We apply this continuation to the problem of gauge theories coupled to matter, and propose the distinction of perimeter law versus “zero law” to identify confinement. We also apply the continuation to local bosonic models with emergent gauge theories. We show that local gauge invariance is topological and cannot be broken by any local perturbations in the bosonic models in either continuous or discrete gauge groups. We show that the ground-state degeneracy in emergent discrete gauge theories is a robust property of the bosonic model, and we argue that the robustness of local gauge invariance in the continuous case protects the gapless gauge boson.},

The main interest in these states draws from their role as a universal resource in the one-way quantum computer [2,3]: Given a collection of sufficiently many particles that are prepared in a cluster state, one can realize any ► quantum computation by simply measuring the particles, one by one, in a specific order and basis (see Fig. 1). By the measurements, one exploits ► correlations in quantum mechanics which are rich enough to allow for universal logical processing. Owing to this property, the cluster state has attracted considerable attention in recent foundational studies on the power of quantum computation. It has also become an interesting object from the perspective of multipartite entanglement theory and the study of quantum mechanical ► nonlocality.",

  abstract = { In this paper we review experimental and theoretical results on higher electronic multipoles in solids with strong correlations. Recent experiments and their theoretical interpretation have confirmed the ordering of octupoles and even higher multipoles in rare-earth and actinide compounds with f electrons. The concept of multipoles is critically examined in point groups where spherical tensors of different ranks mix. Using a phenomenological approach, we demonstrate how linear and nonlinear couplings of different multipoles lead to rich phase diagrams and anomalies in physical observables. As actual representative systems, we first consider Ce x La 1- x B 6 , for which resonant X-ray scattering probed the octupole order for the first time, and NpO 2 , where quadrupoles induced by the octupole order have been observed. We then consider a class of compounds called skutterudites as the most convenient system for systematic study. Particular emphasis is placed on the ordering of scalar components from fourth-rank tensors (hexadecapoles) and sixth-rank tensors (hexacontatetrapoles). A comparison of a skutterudite PrFe 4 P 12 and URu 2 Si 2 is made, where much fewer carriers remain in the ordered states than in the disordered phase. The even number (two) of f electrons per site in Pr 3+ or U 4+ makes the system free from the Kramers degeneracy, in contrast to standard models for Mott transitions. Hence, it is pointed out that multipole orders, particularly the scalar order, should provide a new route for studying the dichotomy between the itinerant and localized behaviors of electrons. }

  abstract  = {We study the renormalization group flow of the Lagrangian for statistical and quantum systems by representing their path integral in terms of a tensor network. Using a tensor-entanglement-filtering renormalization (TEFR) approach that removes local entanglement and coarse grain the lattice, we show that the resulting renormalization flow of the tensors in the tensor network has a nice fixed-point structure. The isolated fixed-point tensors Tinv plus the symmetry group Gsym of the tensors (i.e. the symmetry group of the Lagrangian) characterize various phases of the system. Such a characterization can describe both the symmetry breaking phases and topological phases, as illustrated by 2D statistical Ising model, 2D statistical loop gas model, and 1+1D quantum spin-1/2 and spin-1 models. In particular, using such a (Gsym,Tinv) characterization, we show that the Haldane phase for a spin-1 chain is a phase protected by the time-reversal, parity, and translation symmetries. Thus the Haldane phase is a symmetry protected topological phase. The (Gsym,Tinv) characterization is more general than the characterizations based on the boundary spins and string order parameters. The tensor renormalization approach also allows us to study continuous phase transitions between symmetry breaking phases and/or topological phases. The scaling dimensions and the central charges for the critical points that describe those continuous phase transitions can be calculated from the fixed-point tensors at those critical points.},

  abstract = {We study zero-temperature stability of topological phases of matter under weak time-independent perturbations. Our results apply to quantum spin Hamiltonians that can be written as a sum of geometrically local commuting projectors on a D-dimensional lattice with certain topological order conditions. Given such a Hamiltonian H0, we prove that there exists a constant threshold ϵ\\&gt;0 such that for any perturbation V representable as a sum of short-range bounded-norm interactions, the perturbed Hamiltonian H=H0+ϵV has well-defined spectral bands originating from low-lying eigenvalues of H0. These bands are separated from the rest of the spectra and from each other by a constant gap. The band originating from the smallest eigenvalue of H0 has exponentially small width (as a function of the lattice size). Our proof exploits a discrete version of Hamiltonian flow equations, the theory of relatively bounded operators, and the Lieb–Robinson bound.},

  abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Quantum many-body systems divide into a variety of phases with very different physical properties. The question of what kind of phases exist and how to identify them seems hard especially for strongly interacting systems. Here we make an attempt to answer this question for gapped interacting quantum spin systems whose ground states are short-range correlated. Based on the local unitary equivalence relation between short-range correlated states in the same phase, we classify possible quantum phases for 1D matrix product states, which represent well the class of 1D gapped ground states. We find that in the absence of any symmetry all states are equivalent to trivial product states, which means that there is no topological order in 1D. However, if certain symmetry is required, many phases exist with different symmetry protected topological orders. The symmetric local unitary equivalence relation also allows us to obtain some simple results for quantum phases in higher dimensions when some symmetries are present.}

  abstract  = {Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are gapped short-range-entangled quantum phases with a symmetry G. They can all be smoothly connected to the same trivial product state if we break the symmetry. The Haldane phase of spin-1 chain is the first example of SPT phase which is protected by SO(3) spin rotation symmetry. The topological insulator is another exam- ple of SPT phase which is protected by U(1) and time reversal symmetries. It has been shown that free fermion SPT phases can be systematically described by the K-theory. In this paper, we show that interacting bosonic SPT phases can be systematically described by group cohomology theory: distinct d-dimensional bosonic SPT phases with on-site symmetry G (which may contain anti-unitary time reversal symmetry) can be labeled by the elements in H^{1+d}[G, U_T(1)] - the Borel (1 + d)-group-cohomology classes of G over the G-module U_T(1). The boundary excitations of the non-trivial SPT phases are gapless or degenerate. Even more generally, we find that the different bosonic symmetry breaking short-range-entangled phases are labeled by the following three mathematical objects: (G_H, G_{\Psi}, H^{1+d}[G_{\Psi}, U_T(1)], where G_H is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian and G_{\Psi} the symmetry group of the ground states.c},

  abstract = {Band insulators appear in a crystalline system only when the filling—the number of electrons per unit cell and spin projection—is an integer. At fractional filling, an insulating phase that preserves all symmetries is a Mott insulator; that is, it is either gapless or, if gapped, exhibits fractionalized excitations and topological order. We raise the inverse question—at an integer filling is a band insulator always possible? Here we show that lattice symmetries may forbid a band insulator even at certain integer fillings, if the crystal is non-symmorphic—a property shared by most three-dimensional crystal structures. In these cases, one may infer the existence of topological order if the ground state is gapped and fully symmetric. This is demonstrated using a non-perturbative flux-threading argument, which has immediate applications to quantum spin systems and bosonic insulators in addition to electronic band structures in the absence of spin–orbit interactions.},

  abstract = {Symmetry-protected topological phases generalize the notion of topological insulators to strongly interacting systems of bosons or fermions. A sophisticated group cohomology approach has been used to classify bosonic symmetry-protected topological phases, which however does not transparently predict their properties. Here we provide a physical picture that leads to an intuitive understanding of a large class of symmetry-protected topological phases in d=1,2,3 dimensions. Such a picture allows us to construct explicit models for the symmetry-protected topological phases, write down ground state wave function and discover topological properties of symmetry defects both in the bulk and on the edge of the system. We consider symmetries that include a Z2 subgroup, which allows us to define domain walls. While the usual disordered phase is obtained by proliferating domain walls, we show that symmetry-protected topological phases are realized when these domain walls are decorated, that is, are themselves symmetry-protected topological phases in one lower dimension. This construction works both for unitary Z2 and anti-unitary time reversal symmetry.},

We develop explicit forms of their effective Lagrangian up to the quadratic order in derivatives. We clarify the counting rules of NGB degrees of freedom and completely classify possibilities of such canonically conjugate pairs based on the topology of the coset spaces. Its consequence on the dispersion relations of the NGBs is clarified. We also present simple scaling arguments to see whether interactions among NGBs are marginal or irrelevant, which justifies a lore in the literature about the possibility of symmetry breaking in 1+1 dimensions.}

A staggered field applied to the S=1 antiferromagnetic chain breaks all the symmetries that protect the Haldane phase as a topological phase, reducing it to a trivial phase. That is, the Haldane phase is then connected adiabatically to an antiferromagnetic product state. Nevertheless, as long as the symmetry under site-centered inversion combined with a spin rotation is preserved, the phase is still distinct from another trivial phase. We demonstrate the existence of such distinct symmetry-protected trivial phases using a field-theoretical approach and numerical calculations. Furthermore, a general proof and a non-local order parameter are given in terms of an matrix-product state formulation.}

  abstract = {We determine conditions on the filling of electrons in a crystalline lattice to obtain the equivalent of a band insulator -- a gapped insulator with neither symmetry breaking nor fractionalized excitations. We allow for strong interactions, which precludes a free particle description. Previous approaches that extend the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis argument invoked spin conservation in an essential way, and cannot be applied to the physically interesting case of spin-orbit coupled systems. Here we introduce two approaches, the first an entanglement based scheme, while the second studies the system on an appropriate flat `Bieberbach' manifold to obtain the filling conditions for all 230 space groups. These approaches only assume time reversal rather than spin rotation invariance. The results depend crucially on whether the crystal symmetry is symmorphic. Our results clarify when one may infer the existence of an exotic ground state based on the absence of order, and we point out applications to experimentally realized materials. Extensions to new situations involving purely spin models are also mentioned.}

We show that the construction of fermionic Symmetry Protected Topological orders by Gu and Wen has a hidden dependence on a discrete spin structure on the Euclidean space-time. The spin structure is needed to resolve ambiguities which are otherwise present. An identical ambiguity is shown to arise in the fermionic analog of the string-net construction of 2D topological orders. We argue that the need for a spin structure is a general feature of lattice models with local fermionic degrees of freedom and is a lattice analog of the spin-statistics relation. },

Here, we describe in detail what this picture means for phases of quantum matter that can be understood via band theory and free fermions. The main examples we consider are time-reversal invariant topological insulators and superconductors in 2 or 3 space dimensions.

  abstract  = {The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its higher dimensional generalizations by Oshikawa and Hastings require that translationally invariant 2D spin systems with a half-integer spin per unit cell must either have a continuum of low energy excitations, spontaneously break some symmetries, or exhibit topological order with anyonic excitations. We establish a connection between these constraints and a remarkably similar set of constraints at the surface of a 3D interacting topological insulator. This, combined with recent work on symmetry-enriched topological phases (SETs) with on-site unitary symmetries, enables us to develop a framework for understanding the structure of SETs with both translational and on-site unitary symmetries, including the effective theory of symmetry defects. This framework places stringent constraints on the possible types of symmetry fractionalization that can occur in 2D systems whose unit cell contains fractional spin, fractional charge, or a projective representation of the symmetry group. As a concrete application, we determine when a topological phase must possess a "spinon" excitation, even in cases when spin rotational invariance is broken down to a discrete subgroup by the crystal structure. We also describe the phenomena of "anyonic spin-orbit coupling", which may arise from the interplay of translational and on-site symmetries. These include the possibility of on-site symmetry defect branch lines carrying topological charge per unit length and lattice dislocations inducing on-site symmetry protected degeneracies.},

For an arbitrary self-adjoint operator $$\hat{A}$$whose support is contained in a hypercubic block B inside $$\Lambda $$, we prove that the expectation values of $$\hat{A}$$with respect to these two ensembles are close to each other for large N provided that $$\beta _0$$is sufficiently small and the number of sites in B is $$o(N^{1/2})$$. This establishes the equivalence of ensembles on the level of local states in a large but finite system. The result is essentially that of Brandao and Cramer (here restricted to the case of the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles), but we prove improved estimates in an elementary manner. We also review and prove standard results on the thermodynamic limits of thermodynamic functions and the equivalence of ensembles in terms of thermodynamic functions.

Our central tool is an elucidation of what it means to "gauge" such symmetries. We introduce the notion of a "crystalline topological liquid", and argue that most (and perhaps all) phases of interest are likely to satisfy this criterion. We prove a Crystalline Equivalence Principle, which states that in Euclidean space, crystalline topological liquids with symmetry group G are in one-to-one correspondence with topological phases protected by the same symmetry G, but acting *internally*, where if an element of G is orientation-reversing, it is realized as an anti-unitary symmetry in the internal symmetry group. As an example, we explicitly compute, using group cohomology, a partial classification of bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by crystalline symmetries in (3+1)-D for 227 of the 230 space groups. For the 65 space groups not containing orientation-reversing elements (Sohncke groups), there are no cobordism invariants which may contribute phases beyond group cohomology, and so we conjecture our classification is complete.},

We provide a systematic construction of a wide class of reflection and time-reversal SET phases in terms of a topological path integral defined on general space-time manifolds. An important distinguishing feature of different topological phases with reflection and/or time-reversal symmetry is the value of the path integral on non-orientable space-time manifolds. We derive a simple general formula for the path integral on the manifold $$\Sigma ^2 \times S^1$$, where $$\Sigma ^2$$ is a two-dimensional non-orientable surface and $$S^1$$ is a circle. This also gives an expression for the ground state degeneracy of the SET on the surface $$\Sigma ^2$$ that depends on the reflection symmetry fractionalization class, generalizing the Verlinde formula for ground state degeneracy on orientable surfaces. Consistency of the action of the mapping class group on non-orientable manifolds leads us to a constraint that can detect when a time-reversal or reflection SET phase is anomalous in (2+1)D and, thus, can only exist at the surface of a (3+1)D symmetry protected topological (SPT) state. Given a (2+1)D reflection and/or time-reversal SET phase, we further derive a general formula that determines which (3+1)D reflection and/or time-reversal SPT phase hosts the (2+1)D SET phase as its surface termination.

  abstract  = {The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its extensions forbid trivial phases from arising in certain quantum magnets. Constraining infrared behavior with the ultraviolet data encoded in the microscopic lattice of spins, these theorems tie the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking to the emergence of exotic phases like quantum spin liquids. In this work, we take a new topological perspective on these theorems, by arguing they originate from an obstruction to “trivializing” the lattice under smooth, symmetric deformations, which we call the “lattice homotopy problem.” We conjecture that all LSM-like theorems for quantum magnets (many previously unknown) can be understood from lattice homotopy, which automatically incorporates the full spatial symmetry group of the lattice, including all its point-group symmetries. One consequence is that any spin-symmetric magnet with a half-integer moment on a site with even-order rotational symmetry must be a spin liquid. To substantiate the claim, we prove the conjecture in two dimensions for some physically relevant settings.},

  abstract  = {The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem dictates that emergent low-energy states from a lattice model cannot be a trivial symmetric insulator if the filling per unit cell is not integral and if the lattice translation symmetry and particle number conservation are strictly imposed. In this paper, we compare the one-dimensional gapless states enforced by the LSM theorem and the boundaries of one-higher dimensional strong symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases from the perspective of quantum anomalies. We first note that, they can be both described by the same low-energy effective field theory with the same effective symmetry realizations on low-energy modes, wherein non-on-site lattice translation symmetry is encoded as if it is a local symmetry. In spite of the identical form of the low-energy effective field theories, we show that the quantum anomalies of the theories play different roles in the two systems. In particular, We find that the chiral anomaly is equivalent to the LSM theorem, whereas there is another anomaly, which is not related to the LSM theorem but is intrinsic to the SPT states. As an application, we extend the conventional LSM theorem to multiple-charge multiple-species problems and construct several exotic symmetric insulators. We also find that the (3+1)d chiral anomaly provides only the perturbative stability of the gapless-ness local in the parameter space.},

Here, we review Bose condensation in topologically ordered phases (also called topological symmetry breaking), where the condensing bosons have nontrivial mutual statistics with other quasiparticles in the system. We give a nontechnical overview of the relationship between the phases before and after condensation, drawing parallels with more familiar symmetry-breaking transitions. We then review two important applications of this phenomenon. First, we describe the equivalence between such condensation transitions and pairs of phases with gappable boundaries, as well as examples where multiple types of gapped boundary between the same two phases exist. Second, we discuss how such transitions can lead to global symmetries that exchange or permute anyon types. Finally, we discuss the nature of the critical point, which can be mapped to a conventional phase transition in some—but not all—cases.},

They are characterized by excitations that exhibit restricted mobility, being either immobile under local Hamiltonian dynamics or mobile only in certain directions. These phases do not wholly fit into any of the existing paradigms but connect to areas including glassy quantum dynamics, topological order, spin liquids, elasticity theory, quantum information theory, and gravity. We begin by discussing gapped fracton phases, which may be described using exactly solvable lattice spin models. We then introduce the framework of tensor gauge theory, which provides a powerful complementary perspective and allows us to access gapless fracton phases. We discuss the basic properties of gapless fracton phases and their connections to elasticity theory and gravity. We also discuss what is known about the dynamics and thermodynamics of fractons at nonzero density before concluding with a brief survey of some open problems.},

  abstract  = {A crystalline topological phase is a topological phase with spatial symmetries. In this work, we give a very general physical picture of such phases: A topological phase with spatial symmetry 𝐺 (with internal symmetry 𝐺int≤𝐺) is described by a defect network, a 𝐺-symmetric network of defects in a topological phase with internal symmetry 𝐺int. The defect network picture works both for symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases, in systems of either bosons or fermions. We derive this picture both by physical arguments and by a mathematical derivation from the general framework of Thorngren and Else [Phys. Rev. X 8, 011040 (2018)]. In the case of crystalline SPT phases, the defect network picture reduces to a previously studied dimensional reduction picture, thus establishing the equivalence of this picture with the general framework of Thorngren and Else applied to crystalline SPTs.},

We require the map to conserve an integer-valued charge and to leave the state, e.g. a gapped ground state, invariant. This index is integer-valued and stable under perturbations. In general, the index measures the charge transport across a fiducial line. We show that it reduces to (i) an index of projections in the case of non-interacting fermions, (ii) the charge density for translational invariant systems, and (iii) the quantum Hall conductance in the two-dimensional setting without any additional symmetry. Example (ii) recovers the Lieb–Schultz–Mattis theorem, and (iii) provides a new and short proof of quantization of Hall conductance in interacting many-body systems.}

  abstract  = {When global continuous symmetries are spontaneously broken, there appear gapless collective excitations called Nambu–Goldstone modes (NGMs) that govern the low-energy property of the system. The application of this famous theorem ranges from high-energy particle physics to condensed matter and atomic physics. When a symmetry breaking occurs in systems that lack the Lorentz invariance to start with, as is usually the case in condensed matter systems, the number of resulting NGMs can be lower than that of broken symmetry generators, and the dispersion of NGMs is not necessarily linear. In this article, we review recently established formulae for NGMs associated with broken internal symmetries that work equally for relativistic and nonrelativistic systems. We also discuss complexities of NGMs originating from space-time symmetry breaking. Along the way we cover many illuminating examples from various context. We also present a complementary point of view from the Lieb–Schultz–Mattis theorem.},

  abstract  = {The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem states that a spin system with translation and spin rotation symmetry and half-integer spin per unit cell does not admit a gapped symmetric ground state lacking fractionalized excitations. That is, the ground state must be gapless, spontaneously break a symmetry, or be a gapped spin liquid. Thus, such systems are natural spin-liquid candidates if no ordering is found. In this work, we give a much more general criterion that determines when an LSM-type theorem holds in a spin system. For example, we consider quantum magnets with arbitrary space-group symmetry and/or spin-orbit coupling. Our criterion is intimately connected to recent work on the general classification of topological phases with spatial symmetries and also allows for the computation of an “anomaly” associated with the existence of an LSM theorem. Moreover, our framework is also general enough to encompass recent works on “SPT-LSM” theorems where the system admits a gapped symmetric ground state without fractionalized excitations, but such a ground state must still be nontrivial in the sense of symmetry-protected topological phases.},

  abstract = {We study generalized discrete symmetries of quantum field theories in 1+1D generated by topological defect lines with no inverse. In particular, we describe ’t Hooft anomalies and classify gapped phases stabilized by these symmetries, including new 1+1D topological phases. The algebra of these operators is not a group but rather is described by their fusion ring and crossing relations, captured algebraically as a fusion category. Such data defines a Turaev-Viro/Levin-Wen model in 2+1D, while a 1+1D system with this fusion category acting as a global symmetry defines a boundary condition. This is akin to gauging a discrete global symmetry at the boundary of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. We describe how to “ungauge” the fusion category symmetry in these boundary conditions and separate the symmetry-preserving phases from the symmetry-breaking ones. For Tambara-Yamagami categories and their generalizations, which are associated with Kramers-Wannier-like self-dualities under orbifolding, we develop gauge theoretic techniques which simplify the analysis. We include some examples of CFTs with fusion category symmetry derived from Kramers-Wannier-like dualities as an appetizer for the Part II companion paper.},

  abstract = { Fractons are a new type of quasiparticle which are immobile in isolation, but can often move by forming bound states. Fractons are found in a variety of physical settings, such as spin liquids and elasticity theory, and exhibit unusual phenomenology, such as gravitational physics and localization. The past several years have seen a surge of interest in these exotic particles, which have come to the forefront of modern condensed matter theory. In this review, we provide a broad treatment of fractons, ranging from pedagogical introductory material to discussions of recent advances in the field. We begin by demonstrating how the fracton phenomenon naturally arises as a consequence of higher moment conservation laws, often accompanied by the emergence of tensor gauge theories. We then provide a survey of fracton phases in spin models, along with the various tools used to characterize them, such as the foliation framework. We discuss in detail the manifestation of fracton physics in elasticity theory, as well as the connections of fractons with localization and gravitation. Finally, we provide an overview of some recently proposed platforms for fracton physics, such as Majorana islands and hole-doped antiferromagnets. We conclude with some open questions and an outlook on the field. },

We first prove a theorem for translation invariant spin chains that unifies and extends two theorems proved by two of the authors (Ogata and Tasaki, Commun. Math.

  abstract  = {A system with charge conservation and lattice translation symmetry has a well-defined filling ν, which is a real number representing the average charge per unit cell. We show that if ν is fractional (i.e. not an integer), this imposes very strong constraints on the low-energy theory of the system and give a framework to understand such constraints in great generality, vastly generalizing the Luttinger and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems. The most powerful constraint comes about if ν is continuously tunable (i.e. the system is charge-compressible), in which case we show that the low-energy theory must have a very large emergent symmetry group -- larger than any compact Lie group. An example is the Fermi surface of a Fermi liquid, where the charge at every point on the Fermi surface is conserved. We expect that in many, if not all, cases, even exotic non-Fermi liquids will have the same emergent symmetry group as a Fermi liquid, even though they could have very different dynamics. We call a system with this property an "ersatz Fermi liquid". We show that ersatz Fermi liquids share a number of properties in common with Fermi liquids, including Luttinger's theorem (which is thus extended to a large class of non-Fermi liquids) and periodic "quantum oscillations" in the response to an applied magnetic field. We also establish versions of Luttinger's theorem for the composite Fermi liquid in quantum Hall systems and for spinon Fermi surfaces in Mott insulators. Our work makes connection between filling constraints and the theory of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, in particular through the concept of " 't Hooft anomalies".},

These tensors express how the entanglement is routed, act as a novel type of nonlocal order parameter, and the manner in which their symmetries are reflections of the global entanglement patterns in the full system is described. The manner in which tensor networks enable the construction of real-space renormalization group flows and fixed points is discussed, and the entanglement structure of states exhibiting topological quantum order is examined.

  abstract  = {We show that a quantum state in a lattice spin (boson) system must be long-range entangled if it has non-zero lattice momentum, i.e. if it is an eigenstate of the translation symmetry with eigenvalue eiP≠1. Equivalently, any state that can be connected with a non-zero momentum state through a finite-depth local unitary transformation must also be long-range entangled. The statement can also be generalized to fermion systems. Some non-trivial consequences follow immediately from our theorem: (1) several different types of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Oshikawa-Hastings (LSMOH) theorems, including a previously unknown version involving only a discrete ℤn symmetry, can be derived in a simple manner from our result; (2) a gapped topological order (in space dimension d>1) must weakly break translation symmetry if one of its ground states on torus has nontrivial momentum - this generalizes the familiar physics of Tao-Thouless; (3) our result provides further evidence of the "smoothness" assumption widely used in the classification of crystalline symmetry-protected topological (cSPT) phases.},

  abstract      = {Given any symmetry acting on a d-dimensional quantum field theory, there is an associated (d+1)-dimensional topological field theory known as the Symmetry TFT (SymTFT). The SymTFT is useful for decoupling the universal quantities of quantum field theories, such as their generalized global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies, from their dynamics. In this work, we explore the SymTFT for theories with Kramers-Wannier-like duality symmetry in both (1+1)d and (3+1)d quantum field theories. After constructing the SymTFT, we use it to reproduce the non-invertible fusion rules of duality defects, and along the way we generalize the concept of duality defects to \textit{higher} duality defects. We also apply the SymTFT to the problem of distinguishing intrinsically versus non-intrinsically non-invertible duality defects in (1+1)d.}

  abstract  = {The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem provides a general constraint on quantum many-body systems and plays a significant role in the Haldane gap phenomena and topological phases of matter. Here, we extend the LSM theorem to open quantum systems and establish a general theorem that restricts the steady state and spectral gap of Liouvillians based solely on symmetry. Specifically, we demonstrate that the unique gapped steady state is prohibited when translation invariance and U (1) symmetry are simultaneously present for noninteger filling numbers. As an illustrative example, we find that no dissipative gap is open in the spin-1/2 dissipative Heisenberg model while a dissipative gap can be open in the spin-1 counterpart -- an analog of the Haldane gap phenomena in open quantum systems. Furthermore, we show that the LSM constraint manifests itself in a quantum anomaly of the dissipative form factor of Liouvillians. We also find the LSM constraints due to symmetry intrinsic to open quantum systems, such as Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry. Our work leads to a unified understanding of phases and phenomena in open quantum systems.},

  abstract  = {We study 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries in 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian systems. We consider anomalies in internal and lattice translation symmetries. We derive a microscopic formula for the "anomaly cocycle" using topological defects implementing twisted boundary conditions. The anomaly takes value in the cohomology group H3(G,U(1))×H2(G,U(1)). The first factor captures the anomaly in the internal symmetry group G, and the second factor corresponds to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly involving G and lattice translation. We present a systematic procedure to gauge internal symmetries (that may not act on-site) on the lattice. We show that the anomaly cocycle is the obstruction to gauging the internal symmetry while preserving the lattice translation symmetry. As an application, we construct anomaly-free chiral lattice gauge theories. We demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between (locality-preserving) symmetry operators and topological defects, which is essential for the results we prove. We also discuss the generalization to fermionic theories. Finally, we construct non-invertible lattice translation symmetries by gauging internal symmetries with a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly.}

The anomaly index is a kinematic quantity, it does not depend on the Hamiltonian. We prove that a nonzero anomaly index prohibits any G-invariant Hamiltonian from having G-invariant gapped ground states. Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type theorems are a special case of this result when G involves translations. In the case when the symmetry group G is a Lie group, we define an anomaly index which takes values in the differentiable group cohomology as defined by J.-L. Brylinski and prove a similar result.}

  abstract = {The relaxation behaviour of isolated quantum systems taken out of equilibrium is among the most intriguing questions in many-body physics1. Quantum systems out of equilibrium typically relax to thermal equilibrium states by scrambling local information and building up entanglement entropy. However, kinetic constraints in the Hamiltonian can lead to a breakdown of this fundamental paradigm owing to a fragmentation of the underlying Hilbert space into dynamically decoupled subsectors in which thermalization can be strongly suppressed2–5. Here we experimentally observe Hilbert space fragmentation in a two-dimensional tilted Bose–Hubbard model. Using quantum gas microscopy, we engineer a wide variety of initial states and find a rich set of manifestations of Hilbert space fragmentation involving bulk states, interfaces and defects, that is, two-, one- and zero-dimensional objects. Specifically, uniform initial states with equal particle number and energy differ strikingly in their relaxation dynamics. Inserting controlled defects on top of a global, non-thermalizing chequerboard state, we observe highly anisotropic, subdimensional dynamics, an immediate signature of their fractonic nature6–9. An interface between localized and thermalizing states in turn shows dynamics depending on its orientation. Our results mark the observation of Hilbert space fragmentation beyond one dimension, as well as the concomitant direct observation of fractons, and pave the way for in-depth studies of microscopic transport phenomena in constrained systems.},

In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This implies the presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite chain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model (9).}
